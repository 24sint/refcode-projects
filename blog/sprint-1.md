# About pull Request
**A Comment** is necessary when we made a pull request. Comments are one way of sharing experience and learning with each other. I learn more when different reviewers, review my work and put their comment. 
- Comments, feedback, and suggestions are ways wants to know or ask about what wants to be. There is a review section, and people can request depending on what they feel. There is also a comment section on GitHub. 
- We can agree or disagree with what the reviewer said. But we would tell them the reason or explain why you disagree.

# About GitHub
- **GitHub** is doing for making our work visible in the browser.
_ **GitHub Page** is a page that has our projects or all repositories in our GitHub page.
-  When we **merge** our code, we add the code to our project, and it become updated. 

# HTML best practcise
- I read the Html best practices that are easy to use, and best to practice all in our code as a developer.
- **Clear code**: I like this quote about the clarity of our code.  ## "A house is only as strong as its foundation".

# CSS best practices
- I read and understand the css best practices, and it's also make our code clear and readable. So, would to use the best practices.
- Use **Useful Naming Conventions**. It helps we can redesign our site with out changing the HTML only by modifying the css.
- From the best practices what I learn new, minify CSS file using the **CSS inify CSS file size with CSS Compressors**
_ Use **a master stylesheet** to remove the default browser styling.
- Use **multiple stylesheets** to remove the complexity of the stylesheet and instead of making giant stylesheet.
- Keep, and use a **Color Reference**
**BEM** stands for *Block Element Modifier*. The class name I used before is mostly one word, and if it two word, I will use single (-) to make one word. But in the the BEM it use (--) to adjust the style in the child element the one modifier.
**Gestal** refers to **shape** or **form**, and the principle or lows of the rule describe how the  human eye persive the visual elements.
# Low of Similarty or (Gestal Principles) are;
   - Similarity (Invariance): relationship between similar elements.
   - Continuation; follow the continous flow of visual elements.
   - Clouser (Reification): refer to see complete shapes
   - Proximity (Emergence): simple shapes arrange together to create a more complex image.
   - Figure/Ground (Multi-stability): isolates shapes from background.
   - Symmetry and Order:the design should be balanced and complete.
   
- **Web design and other design** are similar for the concept of designing because both are focus on the user interface or make it more attractive to users. But people may use different principles or rules to make their website or othe project more impressive.

- I read **the Building Blocks of Visual Design**, and it is complicated for me, and I need more understanding to implement on my work.
